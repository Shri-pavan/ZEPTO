# Zepto Inventory & Sales Metrics Dashboard

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project features a dashboard for visualizing key inventory and sales metrics for the quick-commerce company, Zepto. The analysis focuses on pre-aggregated data to provide insights into stock levels, product discounts, and out-of-stock items.

The repository contains the summarized data sheets which serve as the input for the dashboard, showcasing a final report rather than the raw data analysis process itself. The structure suggests the original analysis and visualization were performed in **Microsoft Excel**.

## üìä Dashboard & Analysis Focus

The dashboard is designed to provide a clear overview of operational metrics. The analysis is built upon several key summary tables:

* **Stock Level Analysis:** Visualizes the total quantity of items based on the available stock count.
* **Product Discount Insights:** Shows the relationship between stock availability and the total value of discounts offered.
* **Weight Distribution:** Analyzes the total weight of products grouped by their stock availability.
* **Out of Stock Report:** A key indicator highlighting the count of products that are currently out of stock versus in stock.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

* **Primary Tool:** Microsoft Excel
* **Key Features Used:**
    * **PivotTables:** For creating the initial summary tables found in the data sheets.
    * **Dashboarding:** The data is structured to be used in an interactive Excel dashboard.
    * **Data Visualization:** Uses standard charts (bar, pie, line) to represent the summarized data.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

1.  **Review the Data:**
    * The `Zepto project.xlsx - INPUTS.csv` file contains the clearest view of the summary tables used for the analysis.
    * These files can be viewed directly or imported into Excel to recreate the dashboard.
2.  **Open the Master Excel File (if included):**
    * If you have the master `.xlsx` workbook, open it to view the full interactive dashboard, including the underlying PivotTables and charts.

## üìà Key Questions Addressed

This dashboard is built to answer critical operational questions, such as:

* What is the total quantity of products at different stock levels?
* Are we offering higher discounts on items with low or high stock?
* What is the count of products currently unavailable for customers?
* How does stock availability correlate with the total weight of goods in the inventory?
